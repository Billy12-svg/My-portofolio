        <h4>PROJECTS</h4>
        <p>These are some of the projects that I have been able to work on and complete with the knowledge I have acquired so far and the languages used:
            <ol>

    <h3 id="h3">MY BACKGROUND</h3>
    <h4 id="h4">EDUCATION</h4>
    <P>I have been able to complete both primary and secondary levels of education successfully.In primary, I initially schooled at Riara Springs Primary School and later on moved to Newlight Primary School where I completed my primary school education.</P>

    <h4 id="h4">JOB EXPERIENCE</h4>
    <p>As I am still learning and acquiring skills in both HTML and CSS, I am yet to join the working community. I however hope to be incorporated into the working field very soon as a fullstack developer and be able to put all the skills I will have acquired,by then,to good use. </p>
    <p>I decided to take classes on programming so that even as I join a tertiary institution to undertake computer science studies, I would not go in completely blank. This classes I am taking right now will make sure that I am better equipped and ready to begin my computer science studies.</p>
    <h4 id="h4">INTERESTS AND SKILLS</h4>
    <p>I have many things that are of interest to me as I am always learning new things but at the moment some of my major interests are:
        <ul>
            <li>Web design</li>
            <li>Application development</li>
        </ul>
