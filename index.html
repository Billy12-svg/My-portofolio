        <h4>PROJECTS</h4>

            acquired so far and the languages used:

        <h4 id="h4">EDUCATION</h4>
        <P>I have been able to complete both primary and secondary levels of education successfully.In primary, I
            initially schooled at Riara Springs Primary School and later on moved to Limuru Primary School where I
            completed my primary school education.</P>

        <h4 id="h4">JOB EXPERIENCE</h4>
        <p>As I am still learning and acquiring skills in both HTML and CSS, I am yet to join the working community. I
            however hope to be incorporated into the working field very soon as a fullstack developer and be able to put
            all the skills I will have acquired,by then,to good use. </p>
        <p>For the fact that ive pursued photography and film,software Development is offering me real life skills that
            i can apply to best fit with my photography career. Moreso being able to create and manage my own work is a
            real big step for me </p>
        <h4 id="h4">INTERESTS AND SKILLS</h4>
        <p>I have many things that are of interest to me as I am always learning new things but at the moment some of my
            major interests are: Java Script and CSS
        <ul>
